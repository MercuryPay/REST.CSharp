## Overview

A Visual Studio 2013 solution demonstrating an integration to Mercury's REST API.  This example demonstrates:

* simulated card read from an encrypted reader
* Credit Sale transaction
* ReturnByRecordNo transaction using the information from the credit sale response.

>There are 3 steps to process a payment with Mercury's REST API.

##Step 1: Build Request


```
dynamic data = new
{
InvoiceNo = dt,
Memo = "Your POS Name and Version",
Purchase = "1.09",
Frequency = "OneTime",
RecordNo = "RecordNumberRequested",
RefNo = dt,
EncryptedBlock = encryptedBlock,
EncryptedFormat = "MagneSafe",
EncryptedKey = encryptedKey,
OperatorID = "Current OperatorId",
AccountSource = accountType
};
```

##Step 2: Send Data

We make use of the RestSharp client library to make the REST request below.

```
var client = new RestClient(txtEndPoint.Text);
var request = new RestRequest("Credit/Sale", Method.POST);
request.RequestFormat = DataFormat.Json;
request.AddHeader("Authorization", "Basic " + merchantIdData);
request.AddBody(data);
var response = client.Execute(request);
```

##Step 3: Parse Response

We make use of the JavaScriptSerializer in the System.Web.Script.Serialization namespace to Deserialize the response above.  In this case we are deserializing to a dictionary but we could deserialize to a specific class.

```
var serializer = new JavaScriptSerializer();
dynamic item = serializer.Deserialize<object>(response.Content);

var InvoiceNo = item["InvoiceNo"];
var Purchase = item["Purchase"];
var RecordNo = item["RecordNo"];
var RefNo = item["RefNo"];

```
